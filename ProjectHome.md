# License #

Currently the MIT license is used. The point is to make the code free, so that you are comfortable using it as the basis for other projects of diverse licenses.

I would like to make an unofficial addendum to the license: If you use the project and like it, consider [hiring me](http://blog.emptycrate.com/contact) the next time you have a job opening!
